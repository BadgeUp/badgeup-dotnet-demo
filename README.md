# BadgeUp .NET Demo

Utilizes the [BadgeUp .NET client](https://github.com/BadgeUp/badgeup-dotnet-client) to demonstrate basic event flow. The example assumes that the user has criteria and achievements setup with the `step` key.

To run, set the `INTEGRATION_API_KEY` environment variable to a BadgeUp API key from the [BadgeUp dashboard](https://dashboard.badgeup.io).
